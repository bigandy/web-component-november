# Web Components November 2022

I want to learn more about web components so I have set myself the target of creating one new web component a day for the 30 days of November 2022.

I will use lit to help me create them along with Vite and TS.

## Developing
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. open http://127.0.0.1:5173/ in your browser of choice.

## Building
Two parts: the site and the lib:

### The Site
- `npm run build:site`

### The lib
- `npm run build:lib`

## TODOs
- [x] Create a public website with my work in progress. Here is the site: [https://web-components-november-2022.netlify.app/](https://web-components-november-2022.netlify.app/)
- [x] Create a library from these so that I can use them on my sites in the future.
- [ ] This library will be published to NPM
