# Web Component November 2022

I want to learn more about web components so I have set myself the target of creating one new web component a day for the 30 days of November 2022.

I will use lit to help me create them along with Vite and TS.

## TODOs
I intend to create a library from these so that I can use them on my sites in the future.
I intend also to create a public website with my work in progress.
